This is an add-on library for [libdeci](https://github.com/shdown/libdeci).

It implements high-fanciness multiplication via Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT),
a variant of Fourier transform.

It uses techniques that I described in
[the "Speeding up decimal multiplication" paper](https://github.com/shdown/decimal-multiplication-paper).

For documentation, start reading `decintt.h`.

For intermediate-fanciness multiplication, see [libdeci-kara](https://github.com/shdown/libdeci-kara).
