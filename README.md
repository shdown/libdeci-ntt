This is an add-on library for [libdeci](https://github.com/shdown/libdeci).

It implements fast multiplication via Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT),
a variant of Fourier transform.

It uses techniques that I described in
[the "Speeding up decimal multiplication" paper](https://github.com/shdown/decimal-multiplication-paper).

For documentation, start reading `decintt.h`.
